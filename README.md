Playing with counting word frequencies (and the performance thereof) in various languages. See the full article for context and background: [https://benhoyt.com/writings/count-words/](https://benhoyt.com/writings/count-words/)

To run the tests and benchmarks (you'll need Go, Rust, Python 3, AWK and perhaps other tools installed). Only tested on Linux:

```bash
./test.sh
./benchmark.py
```

For the latest results (run on my machine), see the article's [performance results section](https://benhoyt.com/writings/count-words/#performance-results-and-learnings).
